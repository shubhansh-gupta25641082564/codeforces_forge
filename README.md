## 🧩 Problem README template

````md
# 1800A — Linear Equation
[Codeforces link](https://codeforces.com/contest/.../problem/...)

## Idea
- Key observation: transform into ...
- Use greedy/number-theory/DSU as needed.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## Notes / Pitfalls
- Watch for overflow on sum
- Edge cases: n = 1, negative values

## Quick run
```bash
g++ A.cpp -O2 -std=gnu++17 && ./a.out < samples.txt
````

```

## ⚙️ Templates & Tips
- Keep concise templates with fast I/O, macros (if using C++), and debug toggles.
- Add `__int128` or `long long` guards for large sums.
- Include a `stress_test.py` to compare brute vs optimized on random cases.

---

## 🤝 Contribution Guide
- Fork → branch `feat/<contest>-<problem>` → PR
- Include: problem link, brief approach, complexity, sample tests
- Use descriptive commits: `feat: add 1800A (cpp)`
- Label PR with `language` and `rating`

**PR Checklist:**
- [ ] Solution file present and runnable
- [ ] `README.md` with explanation included
- [ ] Complexity stated
- [ ] Tests added (if possible)

---

## 🧭 Conventions
- File names: `<letter>.<ext>` inside contest folder (A.cpp, B.py)
- Add comment header: contest name, problem link, author
- Prefer readable variable names when not in tight contest templates

---

## 🧪 CI / Testing (optional)
- Add GitHub Actions to run linters and basic Python/C++ compile checks on PRs.
- Optionally run smoke tests for newly added solutions.
